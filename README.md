# EdgeTX SD Card Contents

This repo contains the SD Card contents for all supported EdgeTX Radios.

### Preparing your SD Card

Tools like [Buddy](https://buddy.edgetx.org) will do most of this automatically for you with a couple of clicks. 

However, if you want to do this manually:
1. Download the appropriate zip file for your radio (either listed below, or in [sdcard.json](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard/blob/master/sdcard.json)) from the [releases page](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard/releases) (expand the Assets heading if you don't see the files). 
2. Unzip the zip archive and put the contents onto a FAT32-formatted (NOT exFAT!) SD Card (preferably smaller than 32GB). 
3. If you want the voice pack also, download your preferred voicepack language from the [Voice Pack Repo](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard-sounds/releases), unzip the archive, and add it to your SD card. 

### Platforms

The contents of this repository are organised by color type and screen size, with zip archives generated for each color type and screen size.
